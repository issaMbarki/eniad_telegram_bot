Creating Chapters for the 'IBD' Module Example:

To create two chapters (courses) for the 'IBD' module, follow these steps:

Generating Content Keyboard:
In the 'keyboards/content.js' file, generate the content keyboard by calling the 'generateContent' function and passing "ibd" as the argument.
Example: generateContent("ibd")

Generating Content Menu:
In the 'actions/menuActions.js' file, generate the content menu by calling the 'generateMenuAction' function and passing "ibd" and "content" as arguments.
Example: generateMenuAction("ibd", "content")

Generating Courses Keyboard:
In the 'keyboards/courses.js' file, generate the courses keyboard by calling the 'generateCourses' function and passing "ibd" and the number of courses (2) as arguments.
Example: generateCourses("ibd", 2)

Generating Courses Menu:
In the 'actions/menuActions.js' file, generate the courses menu by calling the 'generateMenuAction' function and passing "ibd" and "course" as arguments.
Example: generateMenuAction("ibd", "course")

Generating Resources:
In the 'actions/documentActions.js' file, generate the resources by calling the 'generateResources' function and passing "ibd", the number of chapters (2), the chapter prefix ("ch"), and the file format ("pdf") as arguments.
Example: generateResources("ibd", 2, "ch", "pdf")

Verify File Existence:
Make sure that the generated files exist in the '/resources/ibd' directory. Specifically, ensure that the following two files are present: 'ibd_ch01.pdf' and 'ibd_ch02.pdf'.
